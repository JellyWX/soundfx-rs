/// ## Options
///
/// To alter how the framework will interpret the command,
/// you can provide options as attributes following this `#[command]` macro.
///
/// Each option has its own kind of data to stock and manipulate with.
/// They're given to the option either with the `#[option(...)]` or `#[option = ...]` syntaxes.
/// If an option doesn't require for any data to be supplied, then it's simply an empty `#[option]`.
///
/// If the input to the option is malformed, the macro will give you can error, describing
/// the correct method for passing data, and what it should be.

/// A macro that transforms `async` functions (and closures) into plain functions, whose

///
/// # Transformation
///
/// The macro transforms an `async` function, which may look like this:
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// async fn foo(n: i32) -> i32 {
///     n + 4
/// }
/// ```
///
/// into this (some details omitted):
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// use std::future::Future;
/// use std::pin::Pin;
///
/// fn foo(n: i32) -> Pin<Box<dyn std::future::Future<Output = i32>>> {
///     Box::pin(async move {
///         n + 4
///     })
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This transformation also applies to closures, which are converted more simply. For instance,
/// this closure:
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # #![feature(async_closure)]
/// #
/// async move |x: i32| {
///     x * 2 + 4
/// }
/// # ;
/// ```
///
/// is changed to:
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// |x: i32| {
///     Box::pin(async move {
///         x * 2 + 4
///     })
/// }
/// # ;
/// ```
///
/// ## How references are handled
///
/// When a function contains references, their lifetimes are constrained to the returned
/// [`Future`]. If the above `foo` function had `&i32` as a parameter, the transformation would be
/// instead this:
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// use std::future::Future;
/// use std::pin::Pin;
///
/// fn foo<'fut>(n: &'fut i32) -> Pin<Box<dyn std::future::Future<Output = i32> + 'fut>> {
///     Box::pin(async move {
///         *n + 4
///     })
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Explicitly specifying lifetimes (in the parameters or in the return type) or complex usage of
/// lifetimes (e.g. `'a: 'b`) is not supported.
///
/// # Necessity for the macro
///
/// The macro performs the transformation to permit the framework to store and invoke the functions.
///
/// Functions marked with the `async` keyword will wrap their return type with the [`Future`] trait,
/// which a state-machine generated by the compiler for the function will implement. This complicates
/// matters for the framework, as [`Future`] is a trait. Depending on a type that implements a trait
/// is done with two methods in Rust:
///
/// 1. static dispatch - generics
/// 2. dynamic dispatch - trait objects
///
/// First method is infeasible for the framework. Typically, the framework will contain a plethora
/// of different commands that will be stored in a single list. And due to the nature of generics,
/// generic types can only resolve to a single concrete type. If commands had a generic type for
/// their function's return type, the framework would be unable to store commands, as only a single
/// [`Future`] type from one of the commands would get resolved, preventing other commands from being
/// stored.
///
/// Second method involves heap allocations, but is the only working solution. If a trait is
/// object-safe (which [`Future`] is), the compiler can generate a table of function pointers
/// (a vtable) that correspond to certain implementations of the trait. This allows to decide
/// which implementation to use at runtime. Thus, we can use the interface for the [`Future`] trait,
/// and avoid depending on the underlying value (such as its size). To opt-in to dynamic dispatch,
/// trait objects must be used with a pointer, like references (`&` and `&mut`) or `Box`. The
/// latter is what's used by the macro, as the ownership of the value (the state-machine) must be
/// given to the caller, the framework in this case.
///
/// The macro exists to retain the normal syntax of `async` functions (and closures), while
/// granting the user the ability to pass those functions to the framework, like command functions
/// and hooks (`before`, `after`, `on_dispatch_error`, etc.).
///
/// # Notes
///
/// If applying the macro on an `async` closure, you will need to enable the `async_closure`
/// feature. Inputs to procedural macro attributes must be valid Rust code, and `async`
/// closures are not stable yet.
